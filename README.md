## üêª A game developer inspired to elevate great stories

Born in France, Grew up in Hong Kong, and graduated with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science and a Bachelors of Arts and Science in Design+ from the University of Hong Kong.

I'm currently looking for opportunities to apply my experience in game development in Europe. My specialty is C++ Programming and C# Programming in Unity.

Aside from coding experiments, I absolutely love collaborating on projects with a creative drive.
